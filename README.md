# Black Box Testing Project

## 📌 Project Description

This project is based on **Black Box Testing**.
In this testing method, the system is tested **without knowing the internal code**.
Only **inputs and outputs** are checked to verify whether the system works correctly or not.


## 🎯 Objective

The main objective of this project is:

* To test the system functionality
* To find errors using black box testing
* To ensure the system meets user requirements

## 🧪 Testing Type Used

* Black Box Testing
* Functional Testing
* Input / Output based testing


## 🛠️ Tools Used

* Google Chrome
* GitHub
* MS Word / Excel (for test cases)
* Windows Operating System


## 📋 Test Cases

Test cases are written to check:

* Valid input
* Invalid input
* Boundary conditions
* Expected output vs actual output


## ▶️ How Testing Was Performed

1. The system requirements were studied
2. Test cases were designed
3. Inputs were given to the system
4. Outputs were observed
5. Results were compared with expected output


## ✅ Results

* System functionality was tested successfully
* Errors were identified using black box testing
* System behavior matched expected results


## 📄 Conclusion

Black box testing helped to verify the system without accessing internal code.
It is useful for checking system functionality from a user’s perspective.
